                                <u>Research Interests</u>:
                                <br>
                                <br>I am interested in animal contests and animal weapons.
                                These two areas overlap considerably when we consider that the majority of species fight
                                using some sort of weapon.
                                Interestingly, the theoretical background behind these two areas does not overlap.
                                We either study animal weapon evolution and assume weapons are important in fighting,
                                or we study animal contests and also assume that that weapons are important.
                                My goal is to merge contest theory to animal weapons by studying weapon function,
                                biomechanics, and evolution,
                                while also studying how these weapon components influences the rules behind animal
                                contests.
                                My ultimate goal is to answer: Why are animal weapons diverse?</font>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <font size="4">Specifically, the topics I am currently interested/working on are:
                                <br>
                                <br>- Animal contests: how resource value and fighting costs influence contest dynamics
                                and resolution; what fighting ability really is; what
                                factors influence the evolution of how contests are terminated.
                                <br>
                                <br>- Weaponry performance and evolution: how biomechanics influence weapon shape (and
                                vice-versa); what sort of selective pressures act on weapons.
                                <br>
                                <br>- Life history and behavior of decapods.
                                <br>
                                <br>I tend to use decapods as models. But, I am always open to (and excited about) new
                                ideas and new models.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <u>Research interests in prose</u>:
                                <br>
                                <br>The wind swept through nearby trees, making leaves whisper tales of cold nights. The
                                moon shined on the sky while I stood
                                there, trying to remain as still as I could, knees deep in freezing water, breathing and
                                observing. I was in the hunt for
                                freshwater crabs for my master's thesis experiments, when a sudden rustle came from the
                                woods. Two horned beetles were
                                struggling to lift each other and conquer the best position on a branch. I laughed
                                silently at myself and came back to
                                task at hand. Entering the river was always the worst part of my study and needed much
                                concentration. As soon as my red
                                flashlight lit the water I saw two crabs battling each other. They were spinning in
                                circles trying to grab each other with
                                their claws. That elegant dance of aggression definitely caught my attention: two fights
                                of armed animals in a single night.
                                How lucky I was. As sudden as the first flashes of daylight rush through your window to
                                warn you the day has begun, I realized:
                                I wanted to know more not only about animal contests, but also about animal weapons.
                                "These two areas overlap considerably",
                                I thought. How surprised and glad I was when I found that current theory does not
                                consider these two areas in full. "There
                                is much work to be done here". And so my journey began.
